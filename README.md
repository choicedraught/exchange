# exchange

A bunch of different scripts for various exchange management tasks.  

Expand-DistributionList.ps1 - spent ages on this and then worked out there is a far easier method :)  Specifically produces an output format that we wanted for the particular project.


Expand-DistributionList2.ps1 - the easier method using the AD Powershell module.
